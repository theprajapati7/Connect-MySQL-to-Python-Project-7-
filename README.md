# Connect-MySQL-to-Python-Project-7-
ðŸ“Š CSV to MySQL to Python Data Analysis Project
This project showcases a complete data analysis pipeline â€” starting from a CSV file, importing it into MySQL, running various SQL queries for aggregation and filtering, and finally visualizing the results in Python.

ðŸ”„ Workflow Overview:
Data Source:

Loaded a .csv file containing structured data (e.g., order date, product ID, amount, etc.).

Database Integration:

Imported the CSV data into a MySQL database.

Created and optimized tables for efficient querying.

SQL Analysis:

Performed several SQL queries using:

SUM() for aggregations

GROUP BY, ORDER BY for grouping and sorting


Created views for reusable logic and optimized queries with indexes.

Python Integration:

Connected Python with MySQL using libraries like pymysql or sqlalchemy.

Fetched the processed data directly into Python for further analysis.

Data Visualization:

Used matplotlib and seaborn to create:

Bar plots

Histograms


Visualized trends, comparisons, and distributions effectively.

ðŸ“Œ Tools & Technologies Used:
MySQL for data storage and query execution

Python for scripting and data handling

Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations

CSV as the original data source
